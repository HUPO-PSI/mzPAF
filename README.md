# mzPAF Peak Annotation Format

The mzPAF proposed standard is a specification for a fragment ion peak annotation format for mass spectra, focused on peptides. This provides for a standardized format for describing the origin of fragment ions to be used in spectral libraries, other formats that aim to describe fragment ions, and software tools that annotate fragment ions.

The main home page for mzPAF is at the PSI web site: [https://psidev.info/mzPAF](https://psidev.info/mzPAF)

# Status

Updated: 2024-10-15

The specification has been resubmitted to the PSI Document Process and is undergoing final community review. It is anticipated to become a formal PSI standard near the end of 2024.
